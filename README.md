For this project in CS300, we were tasked to create a C++ program to input CS course information into a data strucuture, and built functionality to
list all courses alphanumeraically and list out information about a specific course. 

To do this I used a binary tree to ensure fast lookup times and inherent alphanumberical ordering. I also considered that the rebalancing of a tree would only need to happen once a semester, which would keep lookup times consistent.

a roadblock I ran into was how to sort the course names alphanumerically, which I had to think a bit to create a helper function to do this.

This project was helpful for me in terms of thinking about software development because it really made me consider the strengths and weaknesses of different data structures, and how they would align with the task I am trying to solve. In the future I feel like I will consider my options more before jumping into writing code.

I think I wrote a good amount of comments in my code and this helps to make it readable and easy to understand.

My code was adaptable because it serarated menu functions, BST functions, and the main loop in separate C++ files, which allows different parts to be modified without changing thr entire program.
