For this project in CS300, we were tasked to create a C++ program to input CS course information into a data strucuture, and built functionality to
list all courses alphanumeraically and list out information about a specific course. 

To do this I used a binary tree to ensure fast lookup times and inherent alphanumberical ordering. I also considered that the rebalancing of a tree would only need to happen once a semester, which would keep lookup times consistent.

I think I wrote a good amount of comments in my code and this helps to make it readable and easy to understand.

My code was adaptable because it serarated menu functions, BST functions, and the main loop in separate C++ files, which allows different parts to be modified without changing thr entire program.
